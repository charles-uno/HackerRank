Consider a row of n dice all showing 1.

First turn every second die,(2,4,6,â€¦), so that the number showing is
increased by 1. Then turn every third die. The sixth die will now show a
3. Then turn every fourth die and so on until every nth die (only the
last die) is turned. If the die to be turned is showing a 6 then it is
changed to show a 1.

Let f(n) be the number of dice that are showing a 1 when the process
finishes. You are given f(100)=2 and f(10**8)=69.

Find f(10**36).

    # Easy part: for how many N does N**6 <= 10**36? Note this captures
    # all combinations of primes with everything in powers of 6.

    # N0**4 N1**4 ... Nk**4 <= 10**36? Note we need an even number of
    # distinct N. Then, for each, we can also tack on powers of six.
